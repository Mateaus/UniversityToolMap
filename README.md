# UniversityToolMap
Android Application

Main Purpose of Application:
 - To guide individuals to the a destination with as much information as possible given to them at UTSA main campus.

Main Goal:
 - To keep it as compact as possible by utilizing minimal usage on memory so that it can be really responsive.
 - To practice cleaner coding while also utilizing fragments.
 
Reason to build this application:
 - I looked at other applications made for the University which covered a little bit in regards to map locations. If one did, it was slow
 and heavy on the processor. So I decided to make a compact, responsive application that isn't heavy on phone processors so anyone
 can use with ease. Also because I thought it was a fun idea and for good practice.
